In hw2, we have analyzed that zygote is the parent process of all application processes which preloads some java
classes and libraries, which are often used by application processes. So the library region is shared by all application
processes.

Using the vm_inspector program, We have dumped the pagemaps of Zygote, Chrome, Facebook and Amazon Shopping,
and find that they share the system library mapped region(*.so files) and system resouce mapped
region(*.ttf files).
