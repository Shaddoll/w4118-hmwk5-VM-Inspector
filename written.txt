In hw2, we have analyzed that zygote is the parent process of all application processes which preloads some java
classes and libraries, which are often used by application processes. So the library region is shared by all application
processes.

Using the vm_inspector program, We have dumped the pagemaps of Zygote and Chrome and find that they share the system 
library mapped region(*.so files) and system resouce mapped region(*.ttf files). There is a region called `[vectors]`
which is also shared by all application processes.
